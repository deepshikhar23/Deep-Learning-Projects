## Fake News Detection Analysis - LSTM Classification

### Introduction

This project investigates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for detecting fake news articles. It utilizes a deep learning approach to analyze text data and predict whether an article is reliable or potentially unreliable.

### Dataset Information

The project employs a dataset containing news articles with the following attributes:

* **id:** Unique identifier for each news article.
* **title:** Title of the news article.
* **author:** Author of the news article (may be missing).
* **text:** Text content of the article (may be incomplete).
* **label:** Classification label indicating the article's reliability:
    * 1: Unreliable (potentially fake news)
    * 0: Reliable

### Libraries

This project utilizes the following Python libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation:

* pandas: Data analysis and manipulation.
* matplotlib: Data visualization.
* keras (with TensorFlow backend): Deep learning framework for building the LSTM network.
* scikit-learn: Machine learning utilities for pre-processing.
* nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing (optional).

### Neural Network Architecture

The core of this project is an LSTM network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies within text sequences. This allows the model to capture the context and relationships between words in news articles, aiding in fake news detection.

**Note:** The provided accuracy of nearly 98.00% within 30 epochs.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of LSTM networks for classifying fake news articles. By analyzing textual features and leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can identify patterns indicative of unreliable information. The approach can be further refined through hyperparameter tuning and exploration of different neural network architectures.
