# Gender and Age Prediction with CNNs

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying gender and age from facial images.

## Resources

* **Dataset:** UTKFace ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new))

## Dataset Information

The UTKFace dataset is a large collection of over 20,000 facial images with annotations for age, gender, and ethnicity. Images exhibit variations in pose, expression, lighting, occlusion, and resolution. This makes it suitable for tasks like face detection, age estimation, and landmark localization.

## Project Objective

This project trains a CNN model to predict gender (Male/Female) and age from facial images.

## Environment

* **Platform:** Kaggle

## Libraries

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* keras (with TensorFlow backend)
* scikit-learn

## Neural Network Architecture

This project utilizes a CNN architecture specifically designed for image classification. 

## Performance

* **Gender Accuracy:** 90.00%
* **Age Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 6.5 years

## Next Steps

* Explore different CNN architectures for potentially improved performance.
* Implement techniques to address data variations (pose, lighting, etc.).
* Integrate the model into a real-world application.

**Feel free to explore the project code for further details!**
